# ABHUDAYA - AI-Powered Government Welfare Scheme Manager

## Theory in Brief
ABHUDAYA is a revolutionary platform that merges advanced AI with graph-based data modeling to simplify access to government welfare schemes. At its core, ABHUDAYA dynamically connects scheme data—scraped directly from government websites—using a graph-based tracking model. This sophisticated approach allows the system to semantically map user profiles to the most relevant schemes. Powered by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and optical character recognition (OCR) technologies, ABHUDAYA delivers real-time, multi-modal communication across text, voice, and sign language interfaces.

## Solution Overview
ABHUDAYA is engineered as an end-to-end technical solution that redefines how users interact with government welfare schemes:

- **Graph-Based Data Model:**  
  Utilizes a dynamic graph-based tracking model integrated with Gemini-2.0-Flash. Scheme data scraped from government portals is organized into nodes and edges, creating an evolving, real-time map of available welfare schemes.
  
- **AI-Driven Interactions:**  
  The multi-modal AI assistant interacts via both text and voice in 23 Indian languages, enhanced by a custom dataset for Indian Sign Language (ISL). This ensures every user, regardless of language or ability, can navigate the system with ease.

- **Automated Eligibility & Document Verification:**  
  Text extracting and seamless document verification done using Vertex Gemini AI 
- **Geospatial Mapping Integration:**  
  By integrating with Google Maps, ABHUDAYA provides real-time location data, enabling users to pinpoint nearby Common Service Centers (CSCs) with detailed routing, tagging, and event control features.

- **Voice Agent Capabilities:**  
  A dedicated voice-based chatbot in Hindi, Marathi, and English offers an intuitive, hands-free interaction mode.

- **Project IDX Integration:**  
  Developed under Google's Project IDX, ensuring cutting-edge development practices and scalable, robust performance.

## Key Technical Features
- **Graph-Based Tracking Model:**  
  - Leverages Gemini-2.0-Flash for context-aware scheme recommendations.
  - Dynamically maps relationships between user profiles and schemes using data scraped from official sources.

- **Multilingual AI Chatbot:**  
  - Supports 23 Indian regional languages and a custom-built ISL dataset.
  - Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms to interpret and respond to user queries in both text and voice formats.

- **Automated Document Verification:**  
  - Employs Vertex AI' Gemini-2.5-Flash to extract text from documents.
  - Uses Gemini-2.0-Flash to verify and validate document details for eligibility.

- **CSC and Kiosk Locator:**  
  - Integrates with Google Maps for precise geospatial tracking.
  - Offers comprehensive routing, tagging, and navigation features to locate the nearest CSC or kiosk.

- **Voice Agent Integration:**  
  - Delivers an interactive conversational interface using text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs.
  - Available in Hindi, Marathi, and English for a seamless user experience.

## How It Works
1. **User Sign-Up & Profile Creation:**  
   Users register and create profiles by providing key details such as demographics, income, and occupation.
2. **Graph-Based AI Chatbot Interaction:**  
   ABHUDAYA processes user queries through a graph-based model combined with Gemini-2.0-Flash. By leveraging real-time data scraped from government websites, it effectively maps user profiles to the most relevant schemes.
3. **Document Upload & Verification:**  
   Users upload their documents, which are processed via Vertex Gemini AI, which then verifies the extracted data to ensure eligibility and compliance.
4. **Scheme Recommendation:**  
   The system suggests tailored government welfare schemes based on user profiles and verified information.
5. **CSC & Kiosk Locator:**  
   For users with limited connectivity, ABHUDAYA integrates with Ola Maps to locate nearby CSCs and kiosks, complete with detailed navigation and routing features.
6. **Voice Agent Interaction:**  
   A dedicated voice-based interface enables interactive conversations in Hindi, Marathi, and English, catering to various user needs.
7. **Future Expansion:**  
   Planned enhancements include expanding the ISL chatbot using our proprietary dataset and further integration with government portals for streamlined application processing.
